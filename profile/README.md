- Advanced surround sound and immersive audio mixing capabilities.
- Superior integration with video and game development pipelines.

The software is an industry standard for high-end post-production studios working on major motion pictures, broadcast content, and AAA video game titles. Its powerful feature set ensures that sound designers, re-recording mixers, and dialogue editors can work with precision and creativity.

As a continuously evolving platform, Nuendo represents the pinnacle of audio post-production technology, trusted by professionals worldwide to deliver exceptional sonic experiences for visual media.
